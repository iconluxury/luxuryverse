## 0.7.1

### Highlights

* Migrate from Poetry to [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)         
* Simplifications and improvements for Docker Compose files, Traefik Dockerfiles.
* Make the API use its own domain `api.example.com` and the frontend use `dashboard.example.com`. This would make it easier to deploy them separately if you needed that.
* The backend and frontend on Docker Compose now listen on the same port as the local development servers, this way you can stop the Docker Compose services and run the local development servers without changing the frontend configuration.
